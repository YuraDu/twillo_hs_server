# Your App Name (Server)

This is the server-side of your app.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Make sure Node.js is installed on your local machine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Install MongoDB to set up the database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/YuraDXPNetwork/twillo_hs_server.git
   ```
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and provide the necessary environment variables. Here's an example of the `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
   ```

   Replace `your-database-name` with the name of your MongoDB database.

## Development

To start the server in development mode, run the following command:

```shell
npm run start
```

The server will start on the specified port (default is 3000) and connect to the MongoDB database.

## Deployment

- Add instructions for deploying the server-side of your app, such as deploying to cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.

## API Endpoints

- Document your API endpoints and provide examples on how to use them. Include information about request/response formats, authentication, and any other relevant details.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Additional Notes

- Add any other instructions or notes that might be helpful for the tester, such as external dependencies, important configuration files, or known issues.

That's it! The instructions above should help the tester set up and run the server-side of your app locally.
